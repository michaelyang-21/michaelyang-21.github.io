I’m an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto majoring in Engineering Physics and minoring in Artificial Intelligence.

However when I’m not tinkering with tech, you’ll find me writing about something, watching an old Hollywood classic, or debating whether Bette Davis or Katharine Hepburn truly reigns as the queen of the silver screen. Right now, I’m diving deep into classical Hollywood cinema — because let's be real, who doesn't love a good black-and-white melodrama, right?

I’m an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto majoring in Engineering Physics and minoring in Linguistics. I am also currently an equities trader at National Bank Financial.

However, when I’m not buried in code or equations, I’m probably writing, rewatching a classic film, or arguing the finer points of whether Audrey Hepburn or Elizabeth Taylor deserves the crown of Hollywood’s golden age. Right now, I’m diving deep into classical Hollywood cinema — because let's be real, who doesn't love a good black-and-white melodrama, right? Previously, I was a professional go-karter, although now, I race very much for fun.

Feel free to reach out and chat about anything!
